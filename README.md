# PolymerHeatCapacityData
The Excel file Cp_Polymer_Data.xlx has 10 sheets as "Polymer_data_set", "Atom-Type", "Molecular-Type", "Molecular-Attributes", "Atom-Name", Bonding", "Molecular-Weight", "Bond", "Angle", and "Dihedral".
The "Polymer_data_set" has all 188 descriptors. The descriptors are in first row whereas rows 2 to 69 represent different polymers.
The "Atom-Type", "Molecular-Type", and "Molecular-Attributes" have 1, 3, and 4 descriptors, respectively.
The "Atom-Name", Bonding", "Molecular-Weight" have 20, 159, and 1 descriptors, respectively.
The "Bond", "Angle", and "Dihedral" have 68, 64, and 27 descriptors, respectively.
The "Polymer_data_set" is also uploaded in the Polaron Analytics website: https://www.polaronanalytics.com/polymer-descriptor-database
